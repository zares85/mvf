# MVF Global - Developer Tests - ExchangeRates

Thanks for applying for a developer role at MVF. 

We have a simple project which we would like you to take a look at in your own time. 

You can spend as much or as little time on it as you wish. But we would expect to receive a response in a 3-4 days.

The project is a Codeigniter app written in PHP. It contains a SQLite database for simplicity. You will need PHP, SQLite and PDO to run it. The app contains a Model and Controller which contain functions to manage our exchange rate data. 

*Challenge*
How would you improve our code? Fork our repo and let us see your ideas! Things you could think about could be:

1, Adding tests
2, Changing framework
3, Tidying up code
4, Applying coding standards
5, Rewriting using design patterns
